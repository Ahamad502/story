The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, after striking an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The ship was considered unsinkable due to its advanced safety features and engineering. However, the disaster resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The tragedy led to significant changes in maritime regulations, including improved lifeboat requirements and the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.
